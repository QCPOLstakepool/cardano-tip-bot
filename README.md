# cardano-tip-bot
Use [@CardanoTipBot](https://twitter.com/CardanoTipBot) to tip ADA &amp; tokens with Twitter!

## Disclamer
This software is provided to promote engagement in the Twitter [#cardano](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Cardano) community in a fun way. It is not (and should not be) used to store ADA or other native assets of the Cardano blockchain. We are not responsible of lost funds or incorrect balances. Use at your own risks!

## Limitations / Processing delays
This bot uses the Twitter API which has some limits. For example, direct messages can only be queried once per 60 seconds so it can take a little while before receiving an answer.

When handling deposits/withdrawals, the bot transfers to/from the master wallet and waits for a certain amount of blocks before updating your balance. This is to make sure your deposit/withdrawal isn't rollbacked by a chain fork.

## Supported assets
1. ada (6 decimals: `0.000000`) 1 ada = 1000000 lovelace
2. lovelace (0 decimal) 1 lovelace = 0.000001 ada
3. HOSKY (`2aa9c1557fcf8e7caa049fa0911a8724a1cdaf8037fe0b431c6ac664.50494759546f6b656e`) (0 decimal)

Any decimals beyond what's declared above will be discarded. For example `1.23456789 ada` is automatically converted to `1.234567 ada` (ie `1234567 lovelace`).

## Fees
1. Deposit fee: 0.1 developer ada + network transaction fee (about 0.18-0.20 ada)
2. Withdrawal fee: 0.1 developer ada + network transaction fee (about 0.18-0.20 ada)
3. Tip: Free!

## How it works

Each Twitter user gets assigned its own, unique deposit address. The user sends $ada & supported assets to its deposit address to funds its balance. CardanoTipBot will move these funds to a central wallet and update the user's balance in the internal database. The user can now tip other users. The user can also withdraw its $ada & assets at any time.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>I made a deposit, but my account was never credited.</summary>
    
  1. Make sure the bot still scans your deposit address. To reduce load on the servers, addresses without activity are not scanned after 3 hours. You can DM `!deposit` to [@CardanoTipBot](https://twitter.com/CardanoTipBot) to enable the scanning of your address again.
  2. Make sure you deposited enough $ada to pay the fees to transfer to the master wallet. Each UTxO needs at least 1.0 $ada attached so if you deposited exactly 1.0 $ada the bot can't transfer to the master wallet. You can check your deposit address balance on [cardanoscan.io](https://cardanoscan.io). You can also send more $ada to cover the fees. A safe amount to deposit is 1.5 $ada. 
  3. Contact [@QCPOLstakepool](https://twitter.com/QCPOLstakepool) for assistance.
