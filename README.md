## Disclamer / Terms of uses

By using the Cardano Tip Bot you are accepting the following terms :

1. We are not responsible for lost funds or incorrect balances. Use at your own risks!
2. This software is provided to promote engagement in the Twitter [#cardano](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Cardano) community or any Cardano Discord server in a fun way. 

### Examples of recommended uses of the Cardano Tip Bot
1. Tip a Cardano community member for a positive contribution to the ecosystem.
2. Tip a Cardano community member for answering another community member's question with a helpful answer.
3. Tip a Cardano community member for making a tweet that raises a good debate.

### Examples of what cannot be done when using the Cardano Tip Bot
1. The Cardano Tip Bot should not be used for online crowdfunding or to fund any political party.
2. The Cardano Tip Bot can be used with non-Cardano related tweets, but must not spam these non-Cardano related tweets.
3. The Cardano Tip Bot should not be used in a disrespectful manner to insult or discriminate against another Twitter or Discord user
4. The Cardano Tip Bot should not be used in any criminal/illegal activities.
5. Store and/or transfer large amount of ADA or tokens.

If any of the above situations are detected or reported, the account will be blocked from the bot temporarily or permanently.

## Limitations / Processing delays
Twitter version :
This bot uses the Twitter API which has some limits:

1. Direct messages can only be queried once per 60 seconds so it can take a little while before receiving an answer.
2. Tweets have a rate limit of 300 per 3h so the bot might not reply to a tweet after it successfully sent a tip.
3. If the bot can't reply to a tweet, it will try to like the tweet instead. Again, this has a rate limit of 1000 likes per 24h so the bot might not be able to like a tweet after successfully sending a tip.

You can always send `!balance` as direct message to the bot to validate that your tip went through.

Twitter and Discord version :
1. When handling deposits/withdrawals, the bot transfers to/from the master wallet and waits for a certain amount of blocks before updating your balance. This is to make sure your deposit/withdrawal isn't rollbacked by a chain fork.

## Supported assets
1. ada (6 decimals: `0.000000`) 1 ada = 1000000 lovelace
2. lovelace (0 decimal) 1 lovelace = 0.000001 ada
3. HOSKY (`2aa9c1557fcf8e7caa049fa0911a8724a1cdaf8037fe0b431c6ac664.50494759546f6b656e`) (0 decimal)

Any decimals beyond what's declared above will be discarded. For example `1.23456789 ada` is automatically converted to `1.234567 ada` (ie `1234567 lovelace`).

`k`, `M` and `B` suffixes are supported everywhere you can specify an amount:
- `k` = * 1 000 (`1k HOSKY` = `1000 HOSKY`)
- `M` = * 1 000 000 (`1M HOSKY` = `1000000 HOSKY`)
- `B` = * 1 000 000 000 (`1B HOSKY` = `1000000000 HOSKY`)

## Fees
1. Deposit fee: 0.1 developer ada + network transaction fee (about 0.18-0.20 ada)
2. Withdrawal fee: 0.1 developer ada + network transaction fee (about 0.18-0.20 ada)
3. Tip: Free!

## How it works

Each Twitter user or Discord user gets assigned its own, unique deposit address. The user sends $ada & supported assets to its deposit address to funds its balance. CardanoTipBot will move these funds to a central wallet and update the user's balance in the internal database. The user can now tip other users. The user can also withdraw its $ada & assets at any time.

It is not possible to link your Twitter and Discord account at the moment, but it may be possible in the future.

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary>I made a deposit, but my account was never credited.</summary>
    
  1. Make sure the bot still scans your deposit address. To reduce load on the servers, addresses without activity are not scanned after 3 hours. You can DM `!deposit` to [@CardanoTipBot](https://twitter.com/CardanoTipBot) to enable the scanning of your deposit address again.
  2. Make sure you deposited enough $ada to pay the fees to transfer to the master wallet. Each UTxO needs at least 1.0 $ada attached so if you deposited exactly 1.0 $ada the bot can't transfer to the master wallet. You can check your deposit address balance on [cardanoscan.io](https://cardanoscan.io). You can also send more $ada to cover the fees. A safe amount to deposit is 1.5 $ada. 
  3. Contact [@QCPOLstakepool](https://twitter.com/QCPOLstakepool) for assistance.

<details>
    <summary>Can I send/withdraw multiple assets in the same command?</summary>
